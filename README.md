Personal project for managing home theater (and other) devices attached to the home network. 
The intention is to include a universal REST-based remote control system for in-home devices.

This is a very rough initial cut. Currently, just a few things I'm tinkering with. Once I have 
it reliabily communicating with several devices at home, I can refactor to be more extensitble
(based on the learning).
